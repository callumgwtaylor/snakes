Package containing data from the WHO Snake and Snake Antivenom Database For Use In R

Heavy help in creation of this package from these two articles:
[Hilary Parker](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)
[Dave Kleinschmidt](http://www.davekleinschmidt.com/r-packages/)

And of course from Hadley Wickham's [book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)
