Description: This package contains data from the WHO Snake Bite and Antivenom database, for use in R. Data is stored in a tidy format, with some nested variables. Data is not my own, should be attributed to the WHO. Data is not a live stream from the WHO, instead this is as scraped in January 2018. I plan on updating it every few months or so, maybe twice yearly.
